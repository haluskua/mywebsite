Welcome to my portfolio website. This is a SASS workflow template set-up 
# It uses Sass, Autoprefix, Minify css, Npm, sass, -watch sass and gh-pages

// COMMAND LINE
To use this code, clone repo, then install packages from command-line:

# Install packages;
# 'npm run i' 
NOTE: install package as on package.json file 
recommended for jquery version: "^3.4.1"
the rest of the packages should be ok.

// SCRIPTS
# TO RUN Scripts:
Pattern of scripts are- from the terminal - run: 
# 'npm run dev' 
for sass to watch files and update change to local-server which should be opened using VS CODE 'live-server' application'
# 'npm run build' 
to precompile/autoprefix css and then deploy to gh-pages respectively in that order; BUT only before committing changes and pushing it to remote


# SASS-MIXINS & VARIABLES 
The scss file has mixins within its code for re-usability

# Future prospects<...>
I am yet to implement image compression, html-minify
-Also implement LIGHT & DARK them which can be alternated from a button click only in the menu
-Also using this as a template for a REACT- portfolio APPLICATION
